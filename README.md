# My Reads

This is the project for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. It fetches data from backend API and displays list of books. There are different shelfs such as Currently Reading, Want To Read, etc. You can add new books to shelf by searching them.

## To get started

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

- [`getAll`](#getall)
- [`update`](#update)
- [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll();
```

- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
- This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf);
```

- book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
- shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]
- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query);
```

- query: `<String>`
- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
- These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which are

Android, Art, Artificial Intelligence, Astronomy, Austen, Baseball, Basketball, Bhagat, Biography, Brief, Business, Camus, Cervantes, Christie, Classics, Comics, Cook, Cricket, Cycling, Desai, Design, Development, Digital Marketing, Drama, Drawing, Dumas, Education, Everything, Fantasy, Film, Finance, First, Fitness, Football, Future, Games, Gandhi, Homer, Horror, Hugo, Ibsen, Journey, Kafka, King, Lahiri, Larsson, Learn, Literary Fiction, Make, Manage, Marquez, Money, Mystery, Negotiate, Painting, Philosophy, Photography, Poetry, Production, Programming, React, Redux, River, Robotics, Rowling, Satire, Science Fiction, Shakespeare, Singh, Swimming, Tale, Thrun, Time, Tolstoy, Travel, Ultimate, Virtual Reality, Web Development, iOS

This list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
